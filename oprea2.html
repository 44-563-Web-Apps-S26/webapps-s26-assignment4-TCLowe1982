    <p class="name marco giuseppe">DUET—MARCO and GIUSEPPE.</p>

    <p class="song marco giuseppe">We're called gondolieri,<br>
                      But that's a vagary,<br>
                      It's quite honorary<br>
                           The trade that we ply.<br>
                      For gallantry noted<br>
                      Since we were short-coated,<br>
                      To beauty devoted,<br>
                           Giuseppe\Are Marco and I;</p>

    <p class="song marco giuseppe">When morning is breaking,<br>
                      Our couches forsaking,<br>
                      To greet their awaking<br>
                           With carols we come.<br>
                      At summer day's nooning,<br>
                      When weary lagooning,<br>
                      Our mandolins tuning,<br>
                           We lazily thrum.</p>

    <p class="song marco giuseppe">When vespers are ringing,<br>
                      To hope ever clinging,<br>
                      With songs of our singing<br>
                           A vigil we keep,<br>
                      When daylight is fading,<br>
                      Enwrapt in night's shading,<br>
                      With soft serenading<br>
                           We sing them to sleep.</p>

    <p class="song marco giuseppe">We're called gondolieri, etc.</p>

    <p class="name marco giuseppe">RECITATIVE—MARCO and GIUSEPPE.</p>

  <p><span class="name marco">MAR.</span> <span class="speech marco">And now to choose our brides!</span></p>

  <p><span class="name giuseppe">GIU.</span> <span class="speech giuseppe">As all are young and fair,<br>
                 And amiable besides,</span></p>

  <p><span class="name marco giuseppe">BOTH.</span> <span class="speech marco giuseppe">We really do not care<br>
                           A preference to declare.</span></p>

  <p><span class="name marco">MAR.</span> <span class="speech marco">A bias to disclose<br>
                      Would be indelicate—</span></p>

  <p><span class="name giuseppe">GIU.</span> <span class="speech giuseppe">And therefore we propose<br>
                      To let impartial Fate<br>
                      Select for us a mate!</span></p>

  <p><span class="name all">ALL.</span> <span class="speech all">Viva!</span></p>

  <p><span class="name girls">GIRLS.</span> <span class="speech girls">A bias to disclose<br>
                      Would be indelicate—</span></p>

  <p><span class="name chorus">MEN.</span> <span class="speech chorus">But how do they propose<br>
                      To let impartial Fate<br>
                      Select for them a mate?</span></p>

  <p><span class="name giuseppe">GIU.</span> <span class="speech giuseppe">These handkerchiefs upon our eyes be good enough to
  bind,</span></p>

  <p><span class="name marco">MAR.</span> <span class="speech marco">And take good care that both of us are absolutely
  blind;</span></p>

  <p><span class="name marco giuseppe">BOTH.</span> <span class="speech marco giuseppe">Then turn us round—and we, with all convenient
  despatch,<br>
            Will undertake to marry any two of you we catch!</span></p>

  <p><span class="name all">ALL.</span> <span class="speech all">Viva!</span></p>
